* The second command line argument of each sample program is the connection parameter JSON string.

The `sample` program demonstrates how to execute a variety of SQL requests and obtain the results.

    cargo run --bin sample . '{"host":"databasename","user":"guest","password":"please"}'

The `cmdline` program offers a simple command line interface to execute SQL requests.

    cargo run --bin cmdline . '{"host":"databasename","user":"guest","password":"please"}' "select * from DBC.DBCInfo order by 1"

Multiple SQL requests can be specified for the `cmdline` program, and bind values must be specified after each SQL request. Specify bind values as a JSON array of arrays, or specify JSON `null` for no bind values.

    cargo run --bin cmdline . '{"host":"databasename","user":"guest","password":"please"}' \
    "create volatile table vtab (c1 integer, c2 varchar(100)) on commit preserve rows" null \
    "insert into vtab values (?, ?)" '[[123,"hello"],[456,"world"],[789,null]]' \
    "select * from vtab order by 1"

### Connection Parameters

The following table lists the connection parameters currently offered by the driver. Connection parameter values are case-sensitive unless stated otherwise.

Our goal is consistency for the connection parameters offered by this driver and the Teradata JDBC Driver, with respect to connection parameter names and functionality. For comparison, Teradata JDBC Driver connection parameters are [documented here](https://downloads.teradata.com/doc/connectivity/jdbc/reference/current/jdbcug_chapter_2.html#BGBHDDGB).

Parameter               | Default     | Type           | Description
----------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---
`account`               |             | string         | <a id="cp_account"></a>               Specifies the database account. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `ACCOUNT` connection parameter.
`browser`               |             | string         | <a id="cp_browser"></a>               Specifies the command to open the browser for Browser Authentication when `logmech` is `BROWSER`. Browser Authentication is supported for Windows and macOS. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `BROWSER` connection parameter.<br/>The specified command must include a placeholder token, literally specified as `PLACEHOLDER`, which the driver will replace with the Identity Provider authorization endpoint URL. The `PLACEHOLDER` token is case-sensitive and must be specified in uppercase.<br/>&bull; On Windows, the default command is `cmd /c start "title" "PLACEHOLDER"`. Windows command syntax requires the quoted title to precede the quoted URL.<br/>&bull; On macOS, the default command is `open PLACEHOLDER`. macOS command syntax does not allow the URL to be quoted.
`browser_tab_timeout`   | `"5"`       | quoted integer | <a id="cp_browser_tab_timeout"></a>   Specifies the number of seconds to wait before closing the browser tab after Browser Authentication is completed. The default is 5 seconds. The behavior is under the browser's control, and not all browsers support automatic closing of browser tabs. Typically, the tab used to log on will remain open indefinitely, but the second and subsequent tabs will be automatically closed. Specify `0` (zero) to close the tab immediately. Specify `-1` to turn off automatic closing of browser tabs. Browser Authentication is supported for Windows and macOS. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `BROWSER_TAB_TIMEOUT` connection parameter.
`browser_timeout`       | `"180"`     | quoted integer | <a id="cp_browser_timeout"></a>       Specifies the number of seconds that the driver will wait for Browser Authentication to complete. The default is 180 seconds (3 minutes). Browser Authentication is supported for Windows and macOS. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `BROWSER_TIMEOUT` connection parameter.
`code_append_file`      | `"-out"`    | string         | <a id="cp_code_append_file"></a>      Specifies how to display the verification URL and code. Optional when `logmech` is `CODE` and ignored for other `logmech` values. The default `-out` prints the verification URL and code to stdout. Specify `-err` to print the verification URL and code to stderr. Specify a file name to append the verification URL and code to an existing file or create a new file if the file does not exist. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `CODE_APPEND_FILE` connection parameter.
`column_name`           | `"false"`   | quoted boolean | <a id="cp_column_name"></a>           Controls the behavior of cursor `.description` sequence `name` items. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `COLUMN_NAME` connection parameter. False specifies that a cursor `.description` sequence `name` item provides the AS-clause name if available, or the column name if available, or the column title. True specifies that a cursor `.description` sequence `name` item provides the column name if available, but has no effect when StatementInfo parcel support is unavailable.
`concurrent_interval`   | `"1000"`    | quoted integer | <a id="cp_concurrent_interval"></a>   Specifies the interval in milliseconds for Laddered Concurrent Connect (LCC) to wait before starting another concurrent connection attempt.
`concurrent_limit`      | `"3"`       | quoted integer | <a id="cp_concurrent_limit"></a>      Limits the number of concurrent connection attempts.
`connect_failure_ttl`   | `"0"`       | quoted integer | <a id="cp_connect_failure_ttl"></a>   Specifies the time-to-live in seconds to remember the most recent connection failure for each IP address/port combination. The driver subsequently skips connection attempts to that IP address/port for the duration of the time-to-live. The default value of zero disables this feature. The recommended value is half the database restart time. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `CONNECT_FAILURE_TTL` connection parameter.
`connect_function`      | `"0"`       | quoted integer | <a id="cp_connect_function"></a>      Specifies whether the database should allocate a Logon Sequence Number (LSN) for this session, or associate this session with an existing LSN. Specify `0` for a session with no LSN (the default). Specify `1` to allocate a new LSN for the session. Specify `2` to associate the session with the existing LSN identified by the `logon_sequence_number` connection parameter. The database only permits sessions for the same user to share an LSN. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `CONNECT_FUNCTION` connection parameter.
`connect_timeout`       | `"10000"`   | quoted integer | <a id="cp_connect_timeout"></a>       Specifies the timeout in milliseconds for establishing a TCP socket connection. Specify `0` for no timeout. The default is 10 seconds (10000 milliseconds).
`cop`                   | `"true"`    | quoted boolean | <a id="cp_cop"></a>                   Specifies whether COP Discovery is performed. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `COP` connection parameter.
`coplast`               | `"false"`   | quoted boolean | <a id="cp_coplast"></a>               Specifies how COP Discovery determines the last COP hostname. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `COPLAST` connection parameter. When `coplast` is `false` or omitted, or COP Discovery is turned off, then no DNS lookup occurs for the coplast hostname. When `coplast` is `true`, and COP Discovery is turned on, then a DNS lookup occurs for a coplast hostname.
`database`              |             | string         | <a id="cp_database"></a>              Specifies the initial database to use after logon, instead of the user's default database. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `DATABASE` connection parameter.
`dbs_port`              | `"1025"`    | quoted integer | <a id="cp_dbs_port"></a>              Specifies the database port number. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `DBS_PORT` connection parameter.
`encryptdata`           | `"false"`   | quoted boolean | <a id="cp_encryptdata"></a>           Controls encryption of data exchanged between the driver and the database. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `ENCRYPTDATA` connection parameter.
`error_query_count`     | `"21"`      | quoted integer | <a id="cp_error_query_count"></a>     Specifies how many times the driver will attempt to query FastLoad Error Table 1 after a FastLoad operation. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `ERROR_QUERY_COUNT` connection parameter.
`error_query_interval`  | `"500"`     | quoted integer | <a id="cp_error_query_interval"></a>  Specifies how many milliseconds the driver will wait between attempts to query FastLoad Error Table 1. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `ERROR_QUERY_INTERVAL` connection parameter.
`error_table_1_suffix`  | `"_ERR_1"`  | string         | <a id="cp_error_table_1_suffix"></a>  Specifies the suffix for the name of FastLoad Error Table 1. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `ERROR_TABLE_1_SUFFIX` connection parameter.
`error_table_2_suffix`  | `"_ERR_2"`  | string         | <a id="cp_error_table_2_suffix"></a>  Specifies the suffix for the name of FastLoad Error Table 2. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `ERROR_TABLE_2_SUFFIX` connection parameter.
`error_table_database`  |             | string         | <a id="cp_error_table_database"></a>  Specifies the database name for the FastLoad error tables. By default, FastLoad error tables reside in the same database as the destination table being loaded. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `ERROR_TABLE_DATABASE` connection parameter.
`fake_result_sets`      | `"false"`   | quoted boolean | <a id="cp_fake_result_sets"></a>      Controls whether a fake result set containing statement metadata precedes each real result set.
`field_quote`           | `"\""`      | string         | <a id="cp_field_quote"></a>           Specifies a single character string used to quote fields in a CSV file.
`field_sep`             | `","`       | string         | <a id="cp_field_sep"></a>             Specifies a single character string used to separate fields in a CSV file. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `FIELD_SEP` connection parameter.
`gateway_deadline`      | `"50"`      | quoted integer | <a id="cp_gateway_deadline"></a>      Specifies the Gateway deadline in seconds. The driver automatically closes and re-establishes the database socket connection if the OpenID Connect (OIDC) flow takes longer than this. Should be smaller than the Gateway's denial-of-service protection timeout: `gtwcontrol` setting "connection timeout in seconds" with default 60 seconds. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `GATEWAY_DEADLINE` connection parameter.
`govern`                | `"true"`    | quoted boolean | <a id="cp_govern"></a>                Controls FastLoad and FastExport throttling by Teradata workload management rules. When set to `true` (the default), workload management rules may delay a FastLoad or FastExport. When set to `false`, workload management rules will reject rather than delay a FastLoad or FastExport. Equivalent to the Teradata JDBC Driver `GOVERN` connection parameter.
`host`                  |             | string         | <a id="cp_host"></a>                  Specifies the database hostname.
`http_proxy`            |             | string         | <a id="cp_http_proxy"></a>            Specifies the proxy server URL for HTTP connections to TLS certificate verification CRL and OCSP endpoints. The URL must begin with `http://` and must include a colon `:` and port number.

### COP Discovery

The driver provides Communications Processor (COP) discovery behavior when the `cop` connection parameter is `true` or omitted. COP Discovery is turned off when the `cop` connection parameter is `false`.

A database system can be composed of multiple database nodes. One or more of the database nodes can be configured to run the database Gateway process. Each database node that runs the database Gateway process is termed a Communications Processor, or COP. COP Discovery refers to the procedure of identifying all the available COP hostnames and their IP addresses. COP hostnames can be defined in DNS, or can be defined in the client system's `hosts` file. Teradata strongly recommends that COP hostnames be defined in DNS, rather than the client system's `hosts` file. Defining COP hostnames in DNS provides centralized administration, and enables centralized changes to COP hostnames if and when the database is reconfigured.

The `coplast` connection parameter specifies how COP Discovery determines the last COP hostname.
* When `coplast` is `false` or omitted, or COP Discovery is turned off, then the driver will not perform a DNS lookup for the coplast hostname.
* When `coplast` is `true`, and COP Discovery is turned on, then the driver will first perform a DNS lookup for a coplast hostname to obtain the IP address of the last COP hostname before performing COP Discovery. Subsequently, during COP Discovery, the driver will stop searching for COP hostnames when either an unknown COP hostname is encountered, or a COP hostname is encountered whose IP address matches the IP address of the coplast hostname.

Specifying `coplast` as `true` can improve performance with DNS that is slow to respond for DNS lookup failures, and is necessary for DNS that never returns a DNS lookup failure.

When performing COP Discovery, the driver starts with cop1, which is appended to the database hostname, and then proceeds with cop2, cop3, ..., copN. The driver supports domain-name qualification for COP Discovery and the coplast hostname. Domain-name qualification is recommended, because it can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary DNS lookups for DNS search suffixes.

The following table illustrates the DNS lookups performed for a hypothetical three-node database system named "whomooz".

&nbsp; | No domain name qualification | With domain name qualification<br/>(Recommended)
------ | ---------------------------- | ---

Round-robin DNS rotates the list of IP addresses automatically to provide load distribution. Round-robin is only possible with DNS, not with the client system `hosts` file.

The driver supports the definition of multiple IP addresses for COP hostnames and non-COP hostnames.

For the first connection to a particular database system, the driver generates a random number to index into the list of COPs. For each subsequent connection, the driver increments the saved index until it wraps around to the first position. This behavior provides load distribution across all discovered COPs.

The driver masks connection failures to down COPs, thereby hiding most connection failures from the client application. An exception is thrown to the application only when all the COPs are down for that database. If a COP is down, the next COP in the sequence (including a wrap-around to the first COP) receives extra connections that were originally destined for the down COP. When multiple IP addresses are defined in DNS for a COP, the driver will attempt to connect to each of the COP's IP addresses, and the COP is considered down only when connection attempts fail to all of the COP's IP addresses.

If COP Discovery is turned off, or no COP hostnames are defined in DNS, the driver connects directly to the hostname specified in the `host` connection parameter. This permits load distribution schemes other than the COP Discovery approach. For example, round-robin DNS or a TCP/IP load distribution product can be used. COP Discovery takes precedence over simple database hostname lookup. To use an alternative load distribution scheme, either ensure that no COP hostnames are defined in DNS, or turn off COP Discovery with `cop` as `false`.

### Stored Password Protection

#### Overview

Stored Password Protection enables an application to provide a connection password in encrypted form to the driver.

An encrypted password may be specified in the following contexts:
* A login password specified as the `password` connection parameter.
* A login password specified within the `logdata` connection parameter.

If the password, however specified, begins with the prefix `ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD(` then the specified password must follow this format:

`ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD(file:`*PasswordEncryptionKeyFileName*`,file:`*EncryptedPasswordFileName*`)`

Each filename must be preceded by the `file:` prefix. The *PasswordEncryptionKeyFileName* must be separated from the *EncryptedPasswordFileName* by a single comma.

The *PasswordEncryptionKeyFileName* specifies the name of a file that contains the password encryption key and associated information. The *EncryptedPasswordFileName* specifies the name of a file that contains the encrypted password and associated information. The two files are described below.

Stored Password Protection is offered by this driver, the Teradata JDBC Driver, and the Teradata SQL Driver for Python. These drivers use the same file format.

#### Program TJEncryptPassword

A TJEncryptPassword sample program is provided for other programming languages (Java, Python, R, etc.) to create encrypted password files for use with Stored Password Protection.

The TJEncryptPassword program works in conjunction with Stored Password Protection offered by the driver. The TJEncryptPassword program creates the files containing the password encryption key and encrypted password, which can be subsequently specified via the `ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD(` syntax.

You are not required to use the TJEncryptPassword program to create the files containing the password encryption key and encrypted password. You can develop your own software to create the necessary files.

For more information, please refer to the [documentation for the Python version of the TJEncryptPassword program](https://github.com/Teradata/python-driver?tab=readme-ov-file#StoredPasswordProtection).

#### File Locations

For the `ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD(` syntax of the driver, each filename must be preceded by the `file:` prefix.
The *PasswordEncryptionKeyFileName* must be separated from the *EncryptedPasswordFileName* by a single comma. The files can be located in the current directory, specified with a relative path, or specified with an absolute path.

Example for files in the current directory:

    ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD(file:JohnDoeKey.properties,file:JohnDoePass.properties)

Example with relative paths:

    ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD(file:../dir1/JohnDoeKey.properties,file:../dir2/JohnDoePass.properties)

Example with absolute paths on Windows:

    ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD(file:c:/dir1/JohnDoeKey.properties,file:c:/dir2/JohnDoePass.properties)

Example with absolute paths on Linux:

    ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD(file:/dir1/JohnDoeKey.properties,file:/dir2/JohnDoePass.properties)

#### Processing Sequence

The two filenames specified for an encrypted password must be accessible to the driver and must conform to the properties file formats described above. The driver raises an exception if the file is not accessible, or the file does not conform to the required file format.

The driver verifies that the match values in the two files are present, and match each other. The driver raises an exception if the match values differ from each other. The match values are compared to ensure that the two specified files are related to each other, serving as a "sanity check" to help avoid configuration errors. The TJEncryptPassword program uses a timestamp as a shared match value, but a timestamp is not required. Any shared string can serve as a match value. The timestamp is not related in any way to the encryption of the password, and the timestamp cannot be used to decrypt the password.

Before decryption, the driver calculates the MAC using the ciphertext, transformation name, and algorithm parameters if any, and verifies that the calculated MAC matches the expected MAC. The driver raises an exception if the calculated MAC differs from the expected MAC, to indicate that either or both of the files may have been tampered with.

Finally, the driver uses the decrypted password to log on to the database.

<a id="ClientAttributes"></a>

### Client Attributes

Client Attributes record a variety of information about the client system and client software in the system tables `DBC.SessionTbl` and `DBC.EventLog`. Client Attributes are intended to be a replacement for the information recorded in the `LogonSource` column of the system tables `DBC.SessionTbl` and `DBC.EventLog`.

The Client Attributes are recorded at session logon time. Subsequently, the system views `DBC.SessionInfoV` and `DBC.LogOnOffV` can be queried to obtain information about the client system and client software on a per-session basis. Client Attribute values may be recorded in the database in either mixed-case or in uppercase, depending on the session character set and other factors. Analysis of recorded Client Attributes must flexibly accommodate either mixed-case or uppercase values.

Warning: The information in this section is subject to change in future releases of the driver. Client Attributes can be "mined" for information about client system demographics; however, any applications that parse Client Attribute values must be changed if Client Attribute formats are changed in the future.

Client Attributes are not intended to be used for workload management. Instead, query bands are intended for workload management. Any use of Client Attributes for workload management may break if Client Attributes are changed, or augmented, in the future.

#### LogonSource Column

The `LogonSource` column is obsolete and has been superseded by Client Attributes. The `LogonSource` column may be deprecated and subsequently removed in future releases of the database.

When the driver establishes a connection to the database, the driver composes a string value that is stored in the `LogonSource` column of the system tables `DBC.SessionTbl` and `DBC.EventLog`. The `LogonSource` column is included in system views such as `DBC.SessionInfoV` and `DBC.LogOnOffV`. All `LogonSource` values are recorded in the database in uppercase.

The driver follows the format documented in the Teradata Data Dictionary, section "System Views Columns Reference", for network-attached `LogonSource` values. Network-attached `LogonSource` values have eight fields, separated by whitespace. The database composes fields 1 through 3, and the driver composes fields 4 through 8.

Field | Source   | Description
----- | -------- | ---
1     | database | The string `(TCP/IP)` to indicate the connection type
2     | database | The connection's client TCP port number, in hexadecimal

### User STARTUP SQL Request

`CREATE USER` and `MODIFY USER` commands provide `STARTUP` clauses for specifying SQL commands to establish initial session settings. The following table lists several of the SQL commands that may be used to establish initial session settings.

Category                 | SQL command
------------------------ | ---
Diagnostic settings      | `DIAGNOSTIC` ... `FOR SESSION`
Session query band       | `SET QUERY_BAND` ... `FOR SESSION`
Unicode Pass Through     | `SET SESSION CHARACTER SET UNICODE PASS THROUGH ON`
Transaction isolation    | `SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`
Collation sequence       | `SET SESSION COLLATION`
Temporal qualifier       | `SET SESSION CURRENT VALIDTIME AND CURRENT TRANSACTIONTIME`
Date format              | `SET SESSION DATEFORM`
Function tracing         | `SET SESSION FUNCTION TRACE`
Session time zone        | `SET TIME ZONE`

For example, the following command sets a `STARTUP` SQL request for user `susan` to establish read-uncommitted transaction isolation after logon.

    MODIFY USER susan AS STARTUP='SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL RU'

The driver's `runstartup` connection parameter must be `true` to execute the user's `STARTUP` SQL request after logon. The default for `runstartup` is `false`. If the `runstartup` connection parameter is omitted or `false`, then the user's `STARTUP` SQL request will not be executed.

<a id="SessionReconnect"></a>

### Session Reconnect

Your application's connection can be disconnected from the database session in various ways outside the control of the driver, such as
* a network cable being unplugged
* a network communication failure
* an administrator terminating the session with the Monitor partition command `Abort Session`
* an administrator terminating the session with the Gateway command `Kill Session`
* a database restart

When Session Reconnect is enabled, the driver will attempt to reconnect the connection to the database session after a communication failure.

Session Reconnect is enabled when one or more of the following conditions are satisfied:
* Recoverable Network Protocol is in effect
* and/or connection parameter `reconnect_count` is specified (if omitted, the default is 11 attempts)
* and/or connection parameter `reconnect_interval` is specified (if omitted, the default is 30 seconds)

| Maximum possible elapsed time for reconnect attempts
| ---
| (*ReconnectCount* - 1) &times; *ReconnectInterval*

Recoverable Network Protocol (RNP) and Redrive are enabled through a combination of database and driver connection parameters; specifically, the database `dbscontrol` fields `RedriveProtection` (67), `RedriveDefaultParticipation` (68), and `DisableRecoverableNetProtocol` (77), and the driver connection parameter `redrive` with level 2 or higher.
* When RNP and Redrive are enabled, then Session Reconnect works for a variety of failure events, including transient network failures.
* Without Recoverable Network Protocol, Session Reconnect only supports reconnection after a database restart; it does not support reconnection after other events, such as transient network failures.

Session Reconnect | RNP and Redrive | Communication failure handling
----------------- | --------------- | ---
Disabled          | Disabled        | The operation in progress fails, the driver closes the connection and returns an error to the application.
Enabled           | Disabled        | The operation in progress fails, the driver attempts to reconnect and returns an error to the application.<br/>If the reconnect is unsuccessful, the driver closes the connection.<br/>If the reconnect is successful, the database discards a significant part of the session state:<br/>&bull; The current transaction is rolled back.<br/>&bull; All open result sets are discarded.<br/>&bull; All volatile tables are discarded.<br/>&bull; All materialized global temp tables are discarded.<br/>The application must be prepared to accommodate the possible loss of session state at any point in time.
Enabled           | Enabled         | The operation in progress fails and the driver attempts to reconnect.<br/>If the reconnect is unsuccessful, the driver closes the connection.<br/>If the reconnect is successful, the operation is redriven automatically, the session's state is preserved, and no error is returned to the application.

Reconnect is never attempted if a communication failure occurs while the application is closing the connection.

The database enforces a limited time period for reconnecting to a session after a database restart. The amount of time is set using the database administrator program `gtwcontrol`. The standard value is 20 minutes. The database will reject all reconnect attempts after the time period expires.

<a id="TransactionMode"></a>

### Transaction Mode

The `tmode` connection parameter enables an application to specify the transaction mode for the connection.

`tmode`   | Description
--------- | ---
`ANSI`    | Provides American National Standards Institute (ANSI) transaction semantics. This mode is recommended.
`TERA`    | Provides legacy Teradata transaction semantics. This mode is only recommended for legacy applications that require Teradata transaction semantics.
`DEFAULT` | Provides the default transaction mode configured for the database, which may be either ANSI or TERA mode. This is the default when the `tmode` connection parameter is omitted.

While ANSI mode is generally recommended, please note that every application is different, and some applications may need to use TERA mode. The following differences between ANSI and TERA mode might affect a typical user or application:
1. Silent truncation of inserted data occurs in TERA mode, but not ANSI mode. In ANSI mode, the database returns an error instead of truncating data.
2. Tables created in ANSI mode are `MULTISET` by default. Tables created in TERA mode are `SET` tables by default.
3. For tables created in ANSI mode, character columns are `CASESPECIFIC` by default. For tables created in TERA mode, character columns are `NOT CASESPECIFIC` by default.
4. In ANSI mode, character literals are `CASESPECIFIC`. In TERA mode, character literals are `NOT CASESPECIFIC`.

The last two behavior differences, taken together, may cause character data comparisons (such as in `WHERE` clause conditions) to be case-insensitive in TERA mode, but case-sensitive in ANSI mode. This, in turn, can produce different query results in ANSI mode versus TERA mode. Comparing two `NOT CASESPECIFIC` expressions is case-insensitive regardless of mode, and comparing a `CASESPECIFIC` expression to another expression of any kind is case-sensitive regardless of mode. You may explicitly `CAST` an expression to be `CASESPECIFIC` or `NOT CASESPECIFIC` to obtain the character data comparison required by your application.

The Teradata Reference / *SQL Request and Transaction Processing* recommends that ANSI mode be used for all new applications. The primary benefit of using ANSI mode is that inadvertent data truncation is avoided. In contrast, when using TERA mode, silent data truncation can occur when data is inserted, because silent data truncation is a feature of TERA mode.

A drawback of using ANSI mode is that you can only call stored procedures that were created using ANSI mode, and you cannot call stored procedures that were created using TERA mode. It may not be possible to switch over to ANSI mode exclusively, because you may have some legacy applications that require TERA mode to work properly. You can work around this drawback by creating your stored procedures twice, in two different users/databases, once using ANSI mode, and once using TERA mode.

Refer to the Teradata Reference / *SQL Request and Transaction Processing* for complete information regarding the differences between ANSI and TERA transaction modes.

<a id="AutoCommit"></a>

### Auto-Commit

The driver provides auto-commit on and off functionality for both ANSI and TERA mode.

When a connection is first established, it begins with the default auto-commit setting, which is on. When auto-commit is on, the driver is solely responsible for managing transactions, and the driver commits each SQL request that is successfully executed. An application should not execute any transaction management SQL commands when auto-commit is on. An application should not call the `commit` method or the `rollback` method when auto-commit is on.

An application can manage transactions itself by calling the `teradatarustapi::set_autocommit` function with `false` to turn off auto-commit.

    let result = teradatarustapi::set_autocommit(u_log, conn_handle, false)

When auto-commit is off, the driver leaves the current transaction open after each SQL request is executed, and the application is responsible for committing or rolling back the transaction by calling the `teradatarustapi::commit` or the `teradatarustapi::rollback` function, respectively.

Auto-commit remains turned off until the application turns it back on by calling the `teradatarustapi::set_autocommit` function with `true`.

    let result = teradatarustapi::set_autocommit(u_log, conn_handle, true)

Best practices recommend that an application avoid executing database-vendor-specific transaction management commands such as `BT`, `ET`, `ABORT`, `COMMIT`, or `ROLLBACK`, because such commands differ from one vendor to another. (They even differ between Teradata's two modes ANSI and TERA.) Instead, best practices recommend that an application only call the `teradatarustapi::commit` and `teradatarustapi::rollback` functions for transaction management.
1. When auto-commit is on in ANSI mode, the driver automatically executes `COMMIT` after every successful SQL request.
2. When auto-commit is off in ANSI mode, the driver does not automatically execute `COMMIT`. When the application calls the `commit` method, then the driver executes `COMMIT`.
3. When auto-commit is on in TERA mode, the driver does not execute `BT` or `ET`, unless the application explicitly executes `BT` or `ET` commands itself, which is not recommended.
4. When auto-commit is off in TERA mode, the driver executes `BT` before submitting the application's first SQL request of a new transaction. When the application calls the `commit` method, then the driver executes `ET` until the transaction is complete.

As part of the wire protocol between the database and Teradata client interface software (such as this driver), each message transmitted from the database to the client has a bit designated to indicate whether the session has a transaction in progress or not. Thus, the client interface software is kept informed as to whether the session has a transaction in progress or not.

In TERA mode with auto-commit off, when the application uses the driver to execute a SQL request, if the session does not have a transaction in progress, then the driver automatically executes `BT` before executing the application's SQL request. Subsequently, in TERA mode with auto-commit off, when the application uses the driver to execute another SQL request, and the session already has a transaction in progress, then the driver has no need to execute `BT` before executing the application's SQL request.

In TERA mode, `BT` and `ET` pairs can be nested, and the database keeps track of the nesting level. The outermost `BT`/`ET` pair defines the transaction scope; inner `BT`/`ET` pairs have no effect on the transaction because the database does not provide actual transaction nesting. To commit the transaction, `ET` commands must be repeatedly executed until the nesting is unwound. The Teradata wire protocol bit (mentioned earlier) indicates when the nesting is unwound and the transaction is complete. When the application calls the `commit` method in TERA mode, the driver repeatedly executes `ET` commands until the nesting is unwound and the transaction is complete.

In rare cases, an application may not follow best practices and may explicitly execute transaction management commands. Such an application must turn off auto-commit before executing transaction management commands such as `BT`, `ET`, `ABORT`, `COMMIT`, or `ROLLBACK`. The application is responsible for executing the appropriate commands for the transaction mode in effect. TERA mode commands are `BT`, `ET`, and `ABORT`. ANSI mode commands are `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`. An application must take special care when opening a transaction in TERA mode with auto-commit off. In TERA mode with auto-commit off, when the application executes a SQL request, if the session does not have a transaction in progress, then the driver automatically executes `BT` before executing the application's SQL request. Therefore, the application should not begin a transaction by executing `BT`.

The table below lists the parameterized SQL bind-value JSON data types supported by the driver, and indicates the corresponding database data type transmitted to the server.

Bind-value JSON data type | Database data type
------------------------- | ---
number                    | `FLOAT`
string                    | `VARCHAR`

Transforms are used for SQL `ARRAY` data values, and they can be transferred to and from the database as `VARCHAR` values.

Transforms are used for structured UDT data values, and they can be transferred to and from the database as `VARCHAR` values.

<a id="NullValues"></a>

### Null Values

SQL `NULL` values received from the database are returned in result set rows as JSON `null` values.

A JSON `null` value bound to a question-mark parameter marker is transmitted to the database as a `NULL` `VARCHAR` value.

The database does not provide automatic or implicit conversion of a `NULL` `VARCHAR` value to a different destination data type.
* For `NULL` column values in a batch, the driver will automatically convert the `NULL` values to match the data type of the non-`NULL` values in the same column.
* For solitary `NULL` values, your application may need to explicitly specify the data type with the `teradata_parameter` escape function, in order to avoid database error 3532 for non-permitted data type conversion.

<a id="CharacterExportWidth"></a>

### Character Export Width

The driver always uses the UTF8 session character set, and the `charset` connection parameter is not supported. Be aware of the database's *Character Export Width* behavior that adds trailing space padding to fixed-width `CHAR` data type result set column values when using the UTF8 session character set.

The database `CHAR(`_n_`)` data type is a fixed-width data type (holding _n_ characters), and the database reserves a fixed number of bytes for the `CHAR(`_n_`)` data type in response spools and in network message traffic.

UTF8 is a variable-width character encoding scheme that requires a varying number of bytes for each character. When the UTF8 session character set is used, the database reserves the maximum number of bytes that the `CHAR(`_n_`)` data type could occupy in response spools and in network message traffic. When the UTF8 session character set is used, the database appends padding characters to the tail end of `CHAR(`_n_`)` values smaller than the reserved maximum size, so that the `CHAR(`_n_`)` values all occupy the same fixed number of bytes in response spools and in network message traffic.

Work around this drawback by using `CAST` or `TRIM` in SQL `SELECT` statements, or in views, to convert fixed-width `CHAR` data types to `VARCHAR`.

Given a table with fixed-width `CHAR` columns:

`CREATE TABLE MyTable (c1 CHAR(10), c2 CHAR(10))`

Original query that produces trailing space padding:

`SELECT c1, c2 FROM MyTable`

Modified query with either `CAST` or `TRIM` to avoid trailing space padding:

`SELECT CAST(c1 AS VARCHAR(10)), TRIM(TRAILING FROM c2) FROM MyTable`

Or wrap query in a view with `CAST` or `TRIM` to avoid trailing space padding:

`CREATE VIEW MyView (c1, c2) AS SELECT CAST(c1 AS VARCHAR(10)), TRIM(TRAILING FROM c2) FROM MyTable`

`SELECT c1, c2 FROM MyView`

This technique is also demonstrated in sample program `CharPadding.py`.

<a id="EscapeSyntax"></a>

### Escape Syntax

The driver accepts most of the JDBC escape clauses offered by the Teradata JDBC Driver.

#### Date and Time Literals

Date and time literal escape clauses are replaced by the corresponding SQL literal before the SQL request text is transmitted to the database.

Literal Type | Format
------------ | ------
Date         | `{d '`*yyyy-mm-dd*`'}`
Time         | `{t '`*hh:mm:ss*`'}`
Timestamp    | `{ts '`*yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss*`'}`
Timestamp    | `{ts '`*yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.f*`'}`

For timestamp literal escape clauses, the decimal point and fractional digits may be omitted, or 1 to 6 fractional digits *f* may be specified after a decimal point.

#### Scalar Functions

Scalar function escape clauses are replaced by the corresponding SQL expression before the SQL request text is transmitted to the database.

#### LIKE Predicate Escape Character

Within a `LIKE` predicate's *pattern* argument, the characters `%` (percent) and `_` (underscore) serve as wildcards.
To interpret a particular wildcard character literally in a `LIKE` predicate's *pattern* argument, the wildcard character must be preceded by an escape character, and the escape character must be indicated in the `LIKE` predicate's `ESCAPE` clause.

`LIKE` predicate escape character escape clauses are replaced by the corresponding SQL clause before the SQL request text is transmitted to the database.

`{escape '`*EscapeCharacter*`'}`

The escape clause must be specified immediately after the `LIKE` predicate that it applies to.

<a id="esc_outerjoin"></a>

#### Outer Joins

Outer join escape clauses are replaced by the corresponding SQL clause before the SQL request text is transmitted to the database.

`{oj `*TableName* *OptionalCorrelationName* `LEFT OUTER JOIN `*TableName* *OptionalCorrelationName* `ON `*JoinCondition*`}`

`{oj `*TableName* *OptionalCorrelationName* `RIGHT OUTER JOIN `*TableName* *OptionalCorrelationName* `ON `*JoinCondition*`}`

`{oj `*TableName* *OptionalCorrelationName* `FULL OUTER JOIN `*TableName* *OptionalCorrelationName* `ON `*JoinCondition*`}`

<a id="esc_call"></a>

#### Stored Procedure Calls

Stored procedure call escape clauses are replaced by the corresponding SQL clause before the SQL request text is transmitted to the database.

`{call `*ProcedureName*`}`

`{call `*ProcedureName*`(`*CommaSeparatedParameterValues...*`)}`

<a id="esc_nativesql"></a>

#### Native SQL

When a SQL request contains the native SQL escape clause, all escape clauses are replaced in the SQL request text, and the modified SQL request text is returned to the application as a result set containing a single row and a single VARCHAR column. The SQL request text is not transmitted to the database, and the SQL request is not executed. The native SQL escape clause mimics the functionality of the JDBC API `Connection.nativeSQL` method.

`{fn teradata_nativesql}`

<a id="esc_connection"></a>

#### Connection Functions

The following table lists connection function escape clauses that are intended for use with the native SQL escape clause `{fn teradata_nativesql}`.

These functions provide information about the connection, or control the behavior of the connection.
Functions that provide information return locally-cached information and avoid a round-trip to the database.
Connection function escape clauses are replaced by the returned information before the SQL request text is transmitted to the database.

### FastLoad

The driver offers FastLoad, which opens multiple database connections to transfer data in parallel.

Please be aware that this is an early release of the FastLoad feature. Think of it as a beta or preview version. It works, but does not yet offer all the features that JDBC FastLoad offers. FastLoad is still under active development, and we will continue to enhance it in subsequent builds.

FastLoad has limitations and cannot be used in all cases as a substitute for SQL batch insert:
* FastLoad can only load into an empty permanent table.
* FastLoad cannot load additional rows into a table that already contains rows.
* FastLoad cannot load into a volatile table or global temporary table.
* FastLoad cannot load duplicate rows into a `MULTISET` table with a primary index.
* Do not use FastLoad to load only a few rows, because FastLoad opens extra connections to the database, which is time consuming.
* Only use FastLoad to load many rows (at least 100,000 rows) so that the row-loading performance gain exceeds the overhead of opening additional connections.
* FastLoad does not support all database data types. For example, `BLOB` and `CLOB` are not supported.
* FastLoad requires StatementInfo parcel support to be enabled.
* FastLoad requires read access to the DBC.SessionInfoV view to obtain the database Logon Sequence Number of the FastLoad job.
* FastLoad locks the destination table.
* If Online Archive encounters a table being loaded with FastLoad, online archiving of that table will be bypassed.

Your application can bind a single row of data for FastLoad, but that is not recommended because the overhead of opening additional connections causes FastLoad to be slower than a regular SQL `INSERT` for a single row.

How to use FastLoad:
* Auto-commit should be turned off before beginning a FastLoad.
* FastLoad is intended for binding many rows at a time. Each batch of rows must be able to fit into memory.
* When auto-commit is turned off, your application can insert multiple batches in a loop for the same FastLoad.
* Each column's data type must be consistent across every row in every batch over the entire FastLoad.
* The column values of the first row of the first batch dictate what the column data types must be in all subsequent rows and all subsequent batches of the FastLoad.

FastLoad opens multiple data transfer connections to the database. FastLoad evenly distributes each batch of rows across the available data transfer connections, and uses overlapped I/O to send and receive messages in parallel.

To use FastLoad, your application must prepend one of the following escape functions to the `INSERT` statement:
* `{fn teradata_try_fastload}` tries to use FastLoad for the `INSERT` statement, and automatically executes the `INSERT` as a regular SQL statement when the `INSERT` is not compatible with FastLoad.
* `{fn teradata_require_fastload}` requires FastLoad for the `INSERT` statement, and fails with an error when the `INSERT` is not compatible with FastLoad.

Your application can prepend other optional escape functions to the `INSERT` statement:
* `{fn teradata_sessions(`n`)}` specifies the number of data transfer connections to be opened, and is capped at the number of AMPs. The default is the smaller of 8 or the number of AMPs. We recommend avoiding this function to let the driver ask the database how many data transfer connections should be used.
* `{fn teradata_error_table_1_suffix(`suffix`)}` specifies the suffix to append to the name of FastLoad error table 1. The default suffix is `_ERR_1`.
* `{fn teradata_error_table_2_suffix(`suffix`)}` specifies the suffix to append to the name of FastLoad error table 2. The default suffix is `_ERR_2`.
* `{fn teradata_error_table_database(`dbname`)}` specifies the parent database name for FastLoad error tables 1 and 2. By default, the FastLoad error tables reside in the same database as the destination table.
* `{fn teradata_govern_on}` or `{fn teradata_govern_off}` specifies whether Teradata workload management rules may delay or reject the FastLoad. Takes precedence over the `govern` connection parameter.

After beginning a FastLoad, your application can obtain the Logon Sequence Number (LSN) assigned to the FastLoad by prepending the following escape functions to the `INSERT` statement:
* `{fn teradata_nativesql}{fn teradata_logon_sequence_number}` returns the string form of an integer representing the Logon Sequence Number (LSN) for the FastLoad. Returns an empty string if the request is not a FastLoad.

FastLoad does not stop for data errors such as constraint violations or unique primary index violations. After inserting each batch of rows, your application must obtain warning and error information by prepending the following escape functions to the `INSERT` statement:
* `{fn teradata_nativesql}{fn teradata_get_warnings}` returns in one string all warnings generated by FastLoad for the request.
* `{fn teradata_nativesql}{fn teradata_get_errors}` returns in one string all data errors observed by FastLoad for the most recent batch. The data errors are obtained from FastLoad error table 1, for problems such as constraint violations, data type conversion errors, and unavailable AMP conditions.

Your application ends FastLoad by committing or rolling back the current transaction. After commit or rollback, your application must obtain warning and error information by prepending the following escape functions to the `INSERT` statement:
* `{fn teradata_nativesql}{fn teradata_get_warnings}` returns in one string all warnings generated by FastLoad for the commit or rollback. The warnings are obtained from FastLoad error table 2, for problems such as duplicate rows.
* `{fn teradata_nativesql}{fn teradata_get_errors}` returns in one string all data errors observed by FastLoad for the commit or rollback. The data errors are obtained from FastLoad error table 2, for problems such as unique primary index violations.

Warning and error information remains available until the next batch is inserted or until the commit or rollback. Each batch execution clears the prior warnings and errors. Each commit or rollback clears the prior warnings and errors.

#### FastLoad and Vector Columns

The database can use both the `Vector_IO` and `Vector_IO_VARCHAR` transforms for the same SQL `INSERT` request. In contrast, the database has a limitation such that FastLoad can only use a single transform at a time. FastLoad can use either the `Vector_IO` or the `Vector_IO_VARCHAR` transform but cannot use both transforms for the same FastLoad job.
* With `{fn teradata_try_fastload}` the driver will use FastLoad when your application binds either `VARBYTE` or `VARCHAR` values to Vector columns, but not both. The driver will fall back to SQL `INSERT` if your application binds both `VARBYTE` and `VARCHAR` values to Vector columns in the same request.
* With `{fn teradata_require_fastload}` the driver returns an error when your application binds both `VARBYTE` and `VARCHAR` values to Vector columns in the same request.

### FastExport

The driver offers FastExport, which opens multiple database connections to transfer data in parallel.

Please be aware that this is an early release of the FastExport feature. Think of it as a beta or preview version. It works, but does not yet offer all the features that JDBC FastExport offers. FastExport is still under active development, and we will continue to enhance it in subsequent builds.

FastExport has limitations and cannot be used in all cases as a substitute for SQL queries:
* FastExport cannot query a volatile table or global temporary table.
* FastExport supports single-statement SQL `SELECT`, and supports multi-statement requests composed of multiple SQL `SELECT` statements only.
* FastExport supports question-mark parameter markers in `WHERE` clause conditions. However, the database does not permit the equal `=` operator for primary or unique secondary indexes, and will return database error 3695 "A Single AMP Select statement has been issued in FastExport".
* Do not use FastExport to fetch only a few rows, because FastExport opens extra connections to the database, which is time consuming.
* Only use FastExport to fetch many rows (at least 100,000 rows) so that the row-fetching performance gain exceeds the overhead of opening additional connections.
* FastExport does not support all database data types. For example, `BLOB` and `CLOB` are not supported.
* For best efficiency, do not use `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses with FastExport.
* FastExport's result set ordering behavior may differ from a regular SQL query. In particular, a query containing an ordered analytic function may not produce an ordered result set. Use an `ORDER BY` clause to guarantee result set order.
* FastExport requires read access to the DBC.SessionInfoV view to obtain the database Logon Sequence Number of the FastExport job.

FastExport opens multiple data transfer connections to the database. FastExport uses overlapped I/O to send and receive messages in parallel.

To use FastExport, your application must prepend one of the following escape functions to the query:
* `{fn teradata_try_fastexport}` tries to use FastExport for the query, and automatically executes the query as a regular SQL query when the query is not compatible with FastExport.
* `{fn teradata_require_fastexport}` requires FastExport for the query, and fails with an error when the query is not compatible with FastExport.

Your application can prepend other optional escape functions to the query:
* `{fn teradata_sessions(`n`)}` specifies the number of data transfer connections to be opened, and is capped at the number of AMPs. The default is the smaller of 8 or the number of AMPs. We recommend avoiding this function to let the driver ask the database how many data transfer connections should be used.
* `{fn teradata_govern_on}` or `{fn teradata_govern_off}` specifies whether Teradata workload management rules may delay or reject the FastExport. Takes precedence over the `govern` connection parameter.

After beginning a FastExport, your application can obtain the Logon Sequence Number (LSN) assigned to the FastExport by prepending the following escape functions to the query:
* `{fn teradata_nativesql}{fn teradata_logon_sequence_number}` returns the string form of an integer representing the Logon Sequence Number (LSN) for the FastExport. Returns an empty string if the request is not a FastExport.

### CSV Batch Inserts

The driver can read batch insert bind values from a CSV (comma separated values) file. This feature can be used with SQL batch inserts and with FastLoad.

To specify batch insert bind values in a CSV file, the application prepends the escape function `{fn teradata_read_csv(`*CSVFileName*`)}` to the `INSERT` statement.

The application can specify batch insert bind values in a CSV file, or specify bind parameter values, but not both together. The driver returns an error if both are specified together.

Considerations when using a CSV file:
* Each record is on a separate line of the CSV file. Records are delimited by line breaks (CRLF). The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line break.
* The first line of the CSV file is a header line. The header line lists the column names separated by the field separator (e.g. `col1,col2,col3`).
* The field separator defaults to the comma character (`,`). You can specify a different field separator character with the `field_sep` connection parameter or with the `teradata_field_sep` escape function. The specified field separator character must match the actual separator character used in the CSV file.
* Each field can optionally be enclosed by the field quote character, which defaults to the double-quote character (e.g. `"abc",123,efg`). You can specify a different field quote character with the `field_quote` connection parameter or with the `teradata_field_quote` escape function. The field quote character must match the actual field quote character used in the CSV file.
* The field separator and field quote characters cannot be set to the same value. The field separator and field quote characters must be legal UTF-8 characters and cannot be line feed (`\n`) or carriage return (`\r`).
* Field quote characters are only permitted in fields enclosed by field quote characters. Field quote characters must not appear inside unquoted fields (e.g. not allowed `ab"cd"ef,1,abc`).
* To include a field quote character in a quoted field, the field quote character must be repeated (e.g. `"abc""efg""dh",123,xyz`).
* Line breaks, field quote characters, and field separators may be included in a quoted field (e.g. `"abc,efg\ndh",123,xyz`).
* Specify a `NULL` value in the CSV file with an empty value between commas (e.g. `1,,456`).
* A zero-length quoted string specifies a zero-length non-`NULL` string, not a `NULL` value (e.g. `1,"",456`).
* Not all data types are supported. For example, `BLOB`, `BYTE`, and `VARBYTE` are not supported.
* A field length greater than 64KB is transmitted to the database as a `DEFERRED CLOB` for a SQL batch insert. A field length greater than 64KB is not supported with FastLoad.

Limitations when using CSV batch inserts:
* Bound parameter values cannot be specified in the execute method when using the escape function `{fn teradata_read_csv(`*CSVFileName*`)}`.
* The CSV file must contain at least one valid record in addition to the header line containing the column names.
* For FastLoad, the insert operation will fail if the CSV file is improperly formatted and a parser error occurs.
* For SQL batch insert, some records may be inserted before a parsing error occurs. A list of the parser errors will be returned. Each parser error will include the line number (starting at line 1) and the column number (starting at zero).
* Using a CSV file with FastLoad has the same limitations and is used the same way as described in the [FastLoad](#FastLoad) section.

### CSV Export Results

The driver can export query results to CSV files. This feature can be used with SQL query results, with calls to stored procedures, and with FastExport.

To export a result set to a CSV file, the application prepends the escape function `{fn teradata_write_csv(`*CSVFileName*`)}` to the SQL request text.

If the query returns multiple result sets, each result set will be written to a separate file. The file name is varied by inserting the string "_N" between the specified file name and file type extension (e.g. `fileName.csv`, `fileName_1.csv`, `fileName_2.csv`). If no file type extension is specified, then the suffix "_N" is appended to the end of the file name (e.g. `fileName`, `fileName_1`, `fileName_2`).

A stored procedure call that produces multiple dynamic result sets behaves like other SQL requests that return multiple result sets. The stored procedures's output parameter values are exported as the first CSV file.

Example of a SQL request that returns multiple results:

`{fn teradata_write_csv(myFile.csv)}select 'abc' ; select 123`

CSV File Name | Content
------------- | ---
myFile.csv    | First result set
myFile_1.csv  | Second result set

To obtain the metadata for each result set, use the escape function `{fn teradata_fake_result_sets}`. A fake result set containing the metadata will be written to a file preceding each real result set.

Example of a query that returns multiple result sets with metadata:

`{fn teradata_fake_result_sets}{fn teradata_write_csv(myFile.csv)}select 'abc' ; select 123`

CSV File Name | Content
------------- | ---
myFile.csv    | Fake result set containing the metadata for the first result set
myFile_1.csv  | First result set
myFile_2.csv  | Fake result set containing the metadata for the second result set
myFile_3.csv  | Second result set

Exported CSV files have the following characteristics:
* Each record is on a separate line of the CSV file. Records are delimited by line breaks (CRLF).
* Column values are separated by the field separator character, which defaults to the comma character (`,`). You can specify a different field separator character with the `field_sep` connection parameter or with the `teradata_field_sep` escape function.
* The first line of the CSV file is a header line. The header line lists the column names separated by the field separator (e.g. `col1,col2,col3`).
* When necessary, column values are enclosed by the field quote character, which defaults to the double-quote character (`"`). You can specify a different field quote character with the `field_quote` connection parameter or with the `teradata_field_quote` escape function.
* The field separator and field quote characters cannot be set to the same value. The field separator and field quote characters must be legal UTF-8 characters and cannot be line feed (`\n`) or carriage return (`\r`).
* If a column value contains line breaks, field quote characters, and/or field separators in a field, the value is quoted with the field quote character.
* If a column value contains a field quote character, the value is quoted and the field quote character is repeated. For example, column value `abc"def` is exported as `"abc""def"`.
* A `NULL` value is exported to the CSV file as an empty value between field separators (e.g. `123,,456`).
* A non-`NULL` zero-length character value is exported as a zero-length quoted string (e.g. `123,"",456`).

Limitations when exporting to CSV files:
* When the application chooses to export results to a CSV file, the results are not available for the application to fetch in memory.
* A warning is returned if the application specifies an export CSV file for a SQL statement that does not produce a result set.
* Exporting a CSV file with FastExport has the same limitations and is used the same way as described in the [FastExport](#FastExport) section.
* Not all data types are supported. For example, `BLOB`, `BYTE`, and `VARBYTE` are not supported and if one of these column types are present in the result set, an error will be returned.
* `CLOB`, `XML`, `JSON`, and `DATASET STORAGE FORMAT CSV` data types are supported for SQL query results and are exported as string values, but these data types are not supported by FastExport.
